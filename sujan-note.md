1. the module of prediction is trained by using

```
 scikit-learn==0.18.1
```

2. We can't use old library nowadays, due to non-supported library by the scikit-learn management team
3. Only two possible ways =
   (i)-Try to switch to scikit-learn==0.18.1
   (ii)-Install latest and re-train using new version, get out of new module and use it.
